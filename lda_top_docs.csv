I am tempted to use AI in certain aspects of my position, however, I have some reservations. I can't shake the feeling that if I start using AI, my intelligence might start to decrease. Where is the line drawn between increasing productivity versus plain laziness? It's honestly reminiscent of the spelling and grammar and calculator debates people have, where they say those tools are making people dumber. 

On the other hand, I see these companies starting to use AI without taking any of that into consideration because they value increasing productivty more than anything else. So part of me wants to just say, ""f it."""

Huge time saver plus the reports I generated look super professional and informative. 

We are moving from an era of “what you know” to an era of “can you find the information”. We live in a time where we are expected to process vast amounts of information, ranging from your professional work down to political stuff. The human brain is not made to process this level of information and we need to shift our thinking on how we process it or even store it. AI can be a huge time saver for troubleshooting and help you consider different approaches to a particular problem.

For instance, automating repetitive tasks can free up mental space for creativity, strategy, and deeper problem-solving, which are inherently human strengths.

The key lies in intentionality. Ask: Does this tool amplify my skills, or am I outsourcing my growth? For example, using AI to draft emails might save time, but refining the output ensures you stay sharp. Similarly, leaning on AI for data analysis could let you focus on interpreting results and making decisions.

3,0.28169014084507,"doc11","I'm wary of AI because I've seen how it increasingly just gets everything wrong when it comes to translating basic contextual information from plain English into more plain English, often excising important data points or reinterpreting semantically similar ideas ""like height"" and ""size"" into confusing concepts.

AI is basically a very fast-thinking 2-year-old.

So, excel is a perfect example of a good use case. Excel is a series of single-form one-to-one calculations that can be strung together into larger and more complex formulae. But you can SEE the calculations in the spreadsheet. There's no black box, excel isn't inventing new ideas to explain what you're doing.

AI is safe if it's taking a thing you said and moving it to another place. Or it's taking numbers and symbols that don't have any other obvious semantic understanding and translating them into plain language like a funnel or one-way door.

Basically, if there's ambiguity in a translation from one place to another and you don't know the right way to translate it, you're going to get screwed relying on AI systems right now and ignoring the original sources. If the ambiguity is YOUR OWN INFORMATION or YOUR OWN DATA then you're a lot safer wielding AI as a stopgap or shortcut.

NOTE: The director of The Brutalist used this as a good case. A native speaker, he used AI to get the accents right for his actors. This was only possible because HE was already a native speaker and could edit, rerun, adjust, and tweak the final results. If he didn't speak it, it could easily be just gibberish."
